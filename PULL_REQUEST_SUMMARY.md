# Pull Request Summary: Hero Crystal Menu Tab Implementation

## Overview
This PR implements a third tab in the Hero Menu for Hero Crystal management, allowing players to view their crystal's job information and purchase skills using JP (Job Points).

## Changes Made

### New Components
1. **HeroCrystalTab.cs** - Main UI component for the Hero Crystal tab
   - Crystal information display (job, level, stats, JP)
   - Skill grid with 4-column layout
   - Interactive skill buttons with hover tooltips
   - Confirmation dialog for skill purchases
   - Full JP purchase workflow integration

2. **SkillButton (nested class)** - Custom skill icon button
   - Implements `IInputListener` for mouse events
   - Shows learned skills in full color
   - Shows unlearned skills grayed out (50% alpha)
   - Triggers tooltips on hover
   - Triggers purchase flow on click

3. **SkillTooltip (nested class)** - Skill information tooltip
   - Displays skill name (color-coded by learned status)
   - Shows skill type (Active/Passive) and AP cost
   - Shows learn level requirement and JP cost
   - Shows status indicators (Learned, Insufficient JP, Level too low)

### Modified Components
1. **HeroUI.cs** - Extended to support Hero Crystal tab
   - Added `_crystalTab` and `_heroCrystalTab` fields
   - Added third tab in `CreateHeroWindow()`
   - Added `PopulateCrystalTab()` method
   - Updated `ToggleHeroWindow()` to refresh crystal tab
   - Updated `Update()` to handle crystal tab tooltips

### New Assets
1. **Skill Icon Sprites** (SkillIcon1-10)
   - 10 colored square sprites (24x24 pixels)
   - Colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, Orange, Purple, Light Green, Pink
   - Added to UI.atlas and UI.png

### Tests
1. **HeroCrystalTabTests.cs** - Unit tests for the new component
   - `HeroCrystalTab_CanBeCreated()` - Instantiation test
   - `HeroCrystalTab_UpdateWithHero_WithoutCreateContent_ShouldHandleGracefully()` - Graceful error handling
   - `HeroCrystalTab_UpdateWithNullHero_ShouldNotThrow()` - Null safety
   - `HeroCrystalTab_Update_ShouldNotThrow()` - Update loop test
   - All 4 tests passing

## Features Implemented

### Crystal Information Display
- Job name (e.g., "Knight", "Mage")
- Hero level
- Job level (calculated from learned skills)
- Current JP (available to spend)
- Total JP (lifetime earned)
- Total stats (STR, AGI, VIT, MAG)

### Skill Grid
- Displays all skills from hero's current job
- 4-column grid layout with scrolling
- Skills arranged in order from job definition
- Visual distinction between learned/unlearned skills

### Interactive Features
- **Hover tooltips** showing:
  - Skill name (green if learned, white otherwise)
  - Skill type and AP cost
  - Learn level requirement and JP cost
  - Status indicators
- **Click to purchase** with validation:
  - Checks available JP
  - Checks level requirement
  - Shows confirmation dialog
- **Confirmation workflow**:
  - Dialog shows skill details and JP cost
  - Yes/No buttons
  - On confirm: deduct JP, add skill, refresh UI
  - On cancel: close dialog without changes

### Visual Feedback
- Learned skills: full color, green tooltip
- Unlearned (affordable): grayed out, white tooltip
- Unlearned (can't afford): grayed out, red "Insufficient JP" message
- Unlearned (level too low): grayed out, red "Level too low" message

## Technical Details

### Integration Points
- Uses `Hero.GetCurrentJP()`, `Hero.GetTotalJP()`, `Hero.GetJobLevel()`
- Uses `Hero.TryPurchaseSkill(skill)` for JP purchase
- Uses `HeroComponent.LinkedHero` for hero access
- Uses `ISkill` interface for skill data
- Uses `IJob.Skills` for job skill list

### UI Architecture
- Follows existing UI patterns (Tab, Table, ScrollPane)
- Uses Nez UI framework components
- Implements `IInputListener` for custom interactions
- Integrates with existing tooltip system

### Performance
- Minimal memory allocation (skill buttons created once per rebuild)
- Efficient hover detection using Nez's input system
- Only redraws when data changes

## Testing

### Build Results

### No Regressions
- All pre-existing tests still pass
- No new compilation errors
- No new test failures
- Build time unchanged

## Documentation

### Files Created
1. `HERO_CRYSTAL_TAB_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete technical documentation
2. `HERO_CRYSTAL_TAB_UI_MOCKUP.md` - Visual UI representation
3. This PR summary document

### Documentation Coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

All requirements from the issue have been met:

✅ **Add Hero Crystal tab to Hero Menu (UI)**
