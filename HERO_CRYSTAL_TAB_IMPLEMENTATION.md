# Hero Crystal Menu Tab Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Hero Crystal tab in the Hero Menu UI, which allows players to view their crystal's job information and purchase skills using JP (Job Points).

## Components Implemented

### 1. HeroCrystalTab.cs (New File)
**Location:** `/home/runner/work/PitHero/PitHero/PitHero/UI/HeroCrystalTab.cs`

**Features:**
- **Crystal Information Display:**
  - Job Name (e.g., "Knight", "Mage")
  - Hero Level
  - Job Level (calculated based on learned skills)
  - Current JP (available to spend)
  - Total JP (earned across all time)
  - Total Stats (STR, AGI, VIT, MAG)

- **Skill Grid:**
  - Displays all skills from the hero's current job
  - Skills arranged in a 4-column grid layout
  - Each skill represented by a colored icon (SkillIcon1-10)
  - Learned skills shown in full color
  - Unlearned skills shown grayed out (50% alpha)
  - Scrollable when there are many skills

- **Interactive Features:**
  - Hover tooltips showing:
    - Skill name (green if learned, white if not)
    - Skill type (Active/Passive) with AP cost for actives
    - Learn level requirement and JP cost
    - Status indicators (Learned, Insufficient JP, Level too low)
  - Click to purchase unlearned skills
  - Confirmation dialog before spending JP:
    - Shows skill name and JP cost
    - Displays skill details (type, learn level, AP cost)
    - Yes/No buttons for confirmation

- **Skill Purchase Workflow:**
  1. Player clicks on an unlearned skill
  2. System validates:
     - Hero has enough current JP
     - Hero meets the level requirement
  3. Confirmation dialog appears
  4. On "Yes", skill is purchased:
     - JP is deducted from hero's current JP
     - Skill is added to learned skills
     - Skill is added to hero crystal's persistent storage
     - UI refreshes to show updated state
  5. On "No", dialog closes with no action

### 2. HeroUI.cs (Modified)
**Location:** `/home/runner/work/PitHero/PitHero/PitHero/UI/HeroUI.cs`

**Changes:**
- Added `_crystalTab` field for the third tab
- Added `_heroCrystalTab` field for the crystal tab component
- Modified `CreateHeroWindow()` to create and add the Hero Crystal tab
- Added `PopulateCrystalTab()` method to initialize crystal tab content
- Modified `ToggleHeroWindow()` to update crystal tab when window opens
- Modified `Update()` to update crystal tab tooltip position

### 3. Skill Icon Sprites (New Assets)
**Location:** `/home/runner/work/PitHero/PitHero/PitHero/Content/Atlases/UI.atlas` and `UI.png`

**Added Sprites:**
- SkillIcon1 through SkillIcon10 (24x24 pixels each)
- Each icon is a colored square with a darker border
- Colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Magenta, Cyan, Orange, Purple, Light Green, Pink
- Icons are assigned to skills based on skill ID hash (deterministic but varied)

### 4. Unit Tests (New File)
**Location:** `/home/runner/work/PitHero/PitHero/PitHero.Tests/UI/HeroCrystalTabTests.cs`

**Test Coverage:**
- `HeroCrystalTab_CanBeCreated()` - Verifies instantiation
- `HeroCrystalTab_UpdateWithHero_WithoutCreateContent_ShouldHandleGracefully()` - Tests graceful handling of uninitialized state
- `HeroCrystalTab_UpdateWithNullHero_ShouldNotThrow()` - Tests null safety
- `HeroCrystalTab_Update_ShouldNotThrow()` - Tests update loop

All tests pass successfully (4/4 passing).

## Technical Details

### Skill Button Implementation
The `SkillButton` class implements `IInputListener` to handle mouse events:
- `OnMouseEnter()` - Triggers skill tooltip display
- `OnMouseExit()` - Hides skill tooltip
- `OnLeftMouseUp()` - Handles skill click for purchase

### JP System Integration
The implementation integrates with the existing JP system in `Hero.cs` and `HeroCrystal.cs`:
- `Hero.GetCurrentJP()` - Gets available JP
- `Hero.GetTotalJP()` - Gets lifetime JP earned
- `Hero.GetJobLevel()` - Gets current job level
- `Hero.TryPurchaseSkill(skill)` - Purchases a skill if requirements met

### UI Layout
The Hero Crystal tab uses a vertical layout:
```
+------------------------------------------+
| Job: Knight        | Current JP: 500    |
| Level: 10          | Total JP: 1000     |
| Job Level: 5       | STR:20 AGI:15...   |
+------------------------------------------+
|  [Skill Grid - Scrollable]              |
|  [Icon] [Icon] [Icon] [Icon]            |
|  [Icon] [Icon] [Icon] [Icon]            |
|  ...                                     |
+------------------------------------------+
```

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

✅ **Hero Menu has Hero Crystal tab**
   - Third tab added to Hero Menu with label "Hero Crystal"

✅ **Skill grid UI works, JP purchase and confirmation implemented**
   - Skill grid displays all job skills
   - Click triggers purchase flow
   - Confirmation dialog appears before spending JP
   - JP is deducted on confirmation

✅ **Unlearned skills are grayed out and show tooltip with description/JP cost**
   - Unlearned skills rendered with reduced alpha (grayed)
   - Tooltips show skill details including JP cost
   - Tooltips show status (Insufficient JP, Level too low)

✅ **Placeholder art is used for skill icons**
   - 10 colored square sprites created (SkillIcon1-10)
   - Icons assigned to skills deterministically

## Testing Results

### Build Status
- ✅ Solution builds successfully with 0 errors
- ⚠️ 53 warnings (pre-existing, unrelated to changes)

### Test Results
- ✅ 4 new tests added, all passing
- ✅ No test regressions (same 15 pre-existing failures)
- ✅ Total: 337 passing, 15 failing (unchanged from baseline)

## Files Modified
1. `/PitHero/UI/HeroUI.cs` - Integrated third tab
2. `/PitHero/Content/Atlases/UI.atlas` - Added skill icon entries
3. `/PitHero/Content/Atlases/UI.png` - Added skill icon graphics

## Files Created
1. `/PitHero/UI/HeroCrystalTab.cs` - Main implementation
2. `/PitHero.Tests/UI/HeroCrystalTabTests.cs` - Unit tests
3. `/tmp/generate_skill_icons.py` - Sprite generation script (temporary)

## Usage Instructions

### For Players
1. Open Hero Menu (Hero button in UI)
2. Click on "Hero Crystal" tab
3. View crystal information at the top
4. Scroll through skill grid below
5. Hover over skills to see details
6. Click unlearned skills to purchase (if you have enough JP and meet level requirement)
7. Confirm purchase in dialog

### For Developers
The `HeroCrystalTab` component can be extended with:
- Custom skill icon sprites (replace SkillIcon1-10)
- Additional crystal information displays
- Skill description text (currently showing skill kind/type)
- Job mastery indicators
- Skill categories/grouping

## Known Limitations
1. Skill icons are placeholder colored squares
2. Skill tooltips don't include detailed descriptions (would need to be added to ISkill interface)
3. Cannot run game for screenshots due to graphics context requirements in CI environment

## Future Enhancements
- Add proper skill icon art
- Add skill description text field to ISkill
- Add visual feedback for successful purchase (particle effect, sound)
- Add "Master All" button when sufficient JP available
- Add filter/sort options for skill grid
- Add progress bar showing job level progress
