# PitHero - Event-Driven ECS Implementation

This implementation provides the core classes and ECS structure to support the event-driven design described in the Copilot instructions.

## What's Implemented

✅ **Core Event System**
- `IEvent` interface and `BaseEvent` base class
- `EventLog` for storing all events with querying capabilities
- `EventProcessor` for coordinating event processing through systems

✅ **ECS Architecture**
- `Entity` class with component management
- `Component` base class with lifecycle hooks
- `WorldState` for managing all entities and global state

✅ **Game Systems**
- `HeroSystem` - Hero spawning, movement, AI, and interactions
- `PitSystem` - Pit spawning, crystal logic, and area effects
- `TownSystem` - Building placement and area-of-effect behaviors
- `ReplaySystem` - Deterministic replay from event log

✅ **Game Components**
- `HeroComponent` - Health, movement, velocity
- `PitComponent` - Crystal power, effect radius
- `TownBuildingComponent` - Building types and effects
- `RenderComponent` - Visual properties

✅ **Event Types**
- `HeroSpawnEvent`, `HeroMoveEvent`, `HeroDeathEvent`
- `BuildingPlaceEvent`, `PitEvent`

✅ **Configuration**
- `GameConfig` class with all constants and settings

✅ **Game Manager**
- `GameManager` coordinates all systems and provides high-level API

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify the ECS structure works correctly:

```bash
cd PitHero
dotnet run test
```

## Building

```bash
cd PitHero
dotnet build
```

## Architecture Benefits

- **Event-Driven**: All game logic operates through events for deterministic behavior
- **Deterministic Replay**: Every game action can be replayed exactly
- **Thread-Safe**: Core systems use proper locking for multi-threaded access
- **Modular**: Easy to add new systems, components, and events
- **Testable**: Core logic can be tested without graphics dependencies

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Integrating with Nez when dependencies are available
- Adding rendering and UI systems
- Implementing the horizontal strip game window
- Adding user input handling
- Expanding game mechanics (more hero types, building types, pit effects)
