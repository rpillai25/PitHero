# GitHub Copilot Instructions – Pit Hero Event-Driven Version

- The project is written in C# using MonoGame + Nez.
- Game runs as a **horizontal strip** at bottom of screen (borderless, always-on-top, click-through optional)
- Virtual resolution: 1920×600 (internal world 1920×800)
- All world logic is **event-driven**:
  - Every action (hero spawn, move, death, building placement, pit event) is logged as an Event.
  - Systems subscribe to events and deterministically update `WorldState`.
  - Replays are generated by applying events in order.
- ECS pattern:
  - `WorldState` contains all entities and global variables
  - `EventLog` stores timestamped events
  - Systems like `HeroSystem`, `PitSystem`, `TownSystem`, and `ReplaySystem` process events
- Rendering/UI:
  - Live strip renders current `WorldState`
  - Replay overlay renders events from `EventLog` without altering live state
- Keep all constants (sizes, positions, movement speeds) in `GameConfig.cs`
- Maintain integer scaling for pixel-perfect rendering
- Hero movement, AI, pit crystal logic, and building effects should always operate via events
- Ensure the game continues running in idle while the player interacts with other desktop apps
- Copilot should generate:
  - Event classes and handlers
  - Systems that process events deterministically
  - UI components that subscribe to world state
  - Replay overlay logic that replays events from the log
